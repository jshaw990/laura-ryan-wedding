            Ryan and Laura first met online in 2018. Actually, they first
            matched online 3 years prior, but they never ended up meeting in
            person. December 2018, they found each other again. This time a date
            was planned, and they met for dinner at Original Joe’s on Macleod
            Trail. Ryan was nervous but excited to meet Laura and she felt the
            same. They chatted and got to know each other. The conversations
            went very well, it was easy to talk to one another, and the whole
            evening was fun and relaxed. Laura knew right away that something
            just felt right, also Ryan found her to be very cute and was super
            interested in hanging out again. The very next day Laura originally
            had plans to go to a Christmas market with her friend Flo (Maid of
            Honour); but something came up and Flo couldn’t make it, well Ryan
            swoops in and offers to join her instead and they had another
            amazing night walking around the Christmas market downtown then
            going for dinner at Famoso’s Pizza. Ryan was hooked! They were
            creating an amazing connection and getting along so well. They
            couldn’t stop talking to each other every day. Their third date was
            at Zoo Lights at the Calgary Zoo, they had a blast and have made it
            their tradition to go every year on the day they first met! 12.06.18

            Laura ended up meeting Ryan’s family pretty fast in an accidental
            kind of way. His family goes to Heritage Park’s Once Upon A
            Christmas festival for brunch every year, but this year his parents
            couldn't make it so they asked if Laura wanted to go with Ryan, his
            brother, Scott and his future sister in law Kat instead (Best Man
            and Bridesmaid). Well, the night before the brunch Ryan’s parents
            changed their minds and chose to join in and they got to meet Laura
            on their fourth date. The day went very smoothly, Laura and Ryan’s
            family got along very well. Everything about Ryan felt so right to
            Laura!

            Fast Forward to May 2019, Ryan took Laura to his house in Sylvan
            Lake. He had an enjoyable weekend and was trying to make it fun for
            the both of them as he wasn’t feeling the greatest. They rode their
            bikes around town, stopped at a brewery, and played some board
            games. Little did she know that as she was taking a picture, she had
            her game board in full view showing him where all her ships were on
            her board. Luckily Ryan didn’t notice until after they finished the
            game and both had a good laugh over it! Once back at the house Ryan
            chose to rest a bit so he could feel better and Laura took the dogs
            for a walk around the lake. Little did she know then, but that was
            the day Ryan knew he fell in love! 05.20.19

            Laura and Ryan had gone to Sylvan Lake with Scott and Kat to build a
            deck for the house. The first night they were there Ryan suggested
            they all take the dogs for a walk by the water. Earlier in the day,
            Beth (Laura’s sister and Bridesmaid) asked Laura if she thought Ryan
            might propose this weekend. Well of course she said, “No, I don’t
            think he even has got a ring yet.” Well on their walk Laura
            mentioned this conversation to Ryan, Scott, and Kat and they all
            laughed about it and didn’t think much of it after that. Meanwhile,
            Ryan had the ring in his pocket this whole time and once they got
            down to the water, Ryan got down on one knee and asked Laura to
            marry him. She felt so happy, loved, and surprised. Of course, she
            said YES!!! It was such a wonderful and perfect moment at sunset,
            overlooking the water and the lighthouse!

            It was 2 years to the day after Ryan knew he had fallen in love with
            Laura! 05.20.21. She was so glad Scott and Kat could be there to
            celebrate this moment with them and capture a picture too! Ryan says
            “It was one of the most nerve-racking but happiest days of my life
            so far and I will forever be happy I asked Laura to be my wife.”
